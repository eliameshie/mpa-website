Also add the Logo

 

Use the colors from the Logo as the colors for headings – if using colored fonts

 

The front page should have everything  that is under the About tab – I don’t think we need a separate About Tab – that is the info that should be on the from page     I updated the text to over fifty five  years

 

Psychological Services – and within that the  "Provider Membership & Referral Directory" 

Should be clickable to take you to the find a psychologist director

 

Visually I think it would look better if it was not just listed and center – but more set up like the original so you don’t have to scroll down to see everything as people may miss topics

 

On the pages other than the main page I don’t think we need the large picture but just the information – and maybe some smaller pictures to add some interest.  Again any color text should be taken from the Logo

 

Maybe have a Find a Psychologist Tab at the top?
